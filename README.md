    The codes list in this study are primarily used for data preprocessing, trend analysis, and attribution exploration. The specific purpose of each Python script is as follows:
1. Mat-to-csv.py: Format conversion of lake surface water temperature data.
2. NC-TIF.py: Preprocessing of climate factor data.
3. Theil-Sen estimator.py: Calculation of the warming rate of lake surface water temperature.
4. Mann-Kendall.py: Trend analysis of lake surface water temperature warming rates.
5. K-means.py: Classification of sample categories based on urbanization intensity in lake basins.
6. T-test.py: Significance testing of differences in lake surface water warming rates.
7. Code for Sixfold Buffer Zone of Urban Boundary.py:This code is designed to construct the sixfold buffer zone of the urban boundary.
8. Distance from Lake to City Center.py:This code is designed to calculate the distance from the lake to the city center.
9.Detection of Lake Heatwaves.py:This code is designed to detect lake heatwaves.
10.Detection of Lake Resilience.py:This code is designed to detect lake heatwave resilience.
11. The Impact of Urbanization on Lake Heatwaves.py:This code is designed to analyze the mediating effect of urbanization on lake warming and its subsequent impact on lake heatwaves.
12. The Impact of Climate Change on Lake Heatwaves.py:This code is designed to analyze the mediating effect of climate change on lake warming and its subsequent impact on lake heatwaves.
13.Investigation of Lake Heatwave Variations.py:This code is designed to investigate the attribution of differences in lake heatwaves between urbanized and non-urbanized lakes.
